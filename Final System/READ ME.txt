Please run the "RunModel" program to see the full system.
When prompted to input a start location, ball position and end location by the GUI please
make sure all three have been given positions on the map, if they have not the program
will crash.
Depending on how the map is arranged the simulation will take around 2 hours to run on a 
decent peformance computer.
